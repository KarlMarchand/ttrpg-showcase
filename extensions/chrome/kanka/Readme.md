# Install the extension

1. Navigate to chrome://extensions/
2. Click Load unpacked
3. Select ./extensions/chrome/kanka folder

## Troubleshooting

If the frontend doesn't react to Kanka interactions, it might not be running on the port that the extension supports. Make sure that your frontend is running on http://localhost:5173.
